# Combat Chat for Runlite
Combat Chat is a simple and fun Plugin for Runlite that adds flavour text during combat. Your character has a chance during combat to say some flavour text.

Flavor text can range from commenting on the monster at hand, famous one liners from action films and lines we all love from classic video games.


# Road Map 
 - Version 1 : Have player say unique string during combat based on a % roll so as not to spam.
 - Version 2 : Have player make context aware text chat, such as 'I may be low on prayer, but I'll have you!' when the player is low on Prayer points.
 - Version 3 : Allow users to configure settings in the plugin, example: Enabling the 'PVP Mode' would generate strings when engaged with other players.
 - Version 4 : Look into the possibility of extending combat chat to other areas of Runescape, such as skilling etc.


# Please Note:
This plugin is my first ever Java project, I am doing this to learn Java syntax and best practice for my day job, all feedback is appreciated, so long as it is done with this understanding in mind.
